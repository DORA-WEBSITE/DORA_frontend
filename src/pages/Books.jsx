    description:
      "From the author's pen- In this book I have tried to capture my own moments of rebirth, where I have started seeing the world a little differently. I hope it makes you think about this beautiful world deeper than we usually do - more lovingly and more romantically. Apart from seeing the beauty in the mundane, this book is also about accepting that which we most want to run away from. In a world that often shies away from difficult emotions, Reborn dares to embrace them—to delve into the shadows and uncover the hidden truths that lie within. It's about understanding that negative emotions like sadness, jealousy, envy and hatred, far from being monsters to be feared, are simply messengers, urging us to pay attention and learn. Through this book, I want to take you, my reader, on a journey—a journey of introspection and self-discovery. And it is my hope that this book sparks a curiosity within you to explore your feelings and ponder life's mysteries with a fresh perspective. Who knows what might come of it? I want... however tough things get and regardless of how many times you want to give up on understanding and love... I want Reborn to be a reminder that that darkness is not the end, but the very seed which blossoms into light. Imagine a world where we all see each other as radiant lights, shining together in harmony and greater strength without needing to dim anyone else's radiance. This is what Reborn stands for.",
